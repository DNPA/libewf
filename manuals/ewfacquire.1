.Nd acquires data in the EWF format

.Va Ar source
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm ewfacquire
is a utility to acquire media data from a
.Ar source
and store it in EWF format (Expert Witness Compression Format).
.Nm ewfacquire
acquires media data in a format equivalent to EnCase and FTK imager, including meta data.
Under Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, MacOS\-X/Darwin
.Nm ewfacquire
supports reading directly from device files.
On other platforms
.Nm ewfacquire
can convert a raw (dd) image into the EWF format.
.Pp
.Nm ewfacquire
is part of the
.Nm libewf
package.
.Nm libewf
is a library to support the Expert Witness Compression Format (EWF).
.Nm libewf
supports both the SMART format (EWF-S01) and the EnCase format (EWF-E01).
.Nm libewf
currently does not support the Logical Volume format (EWF-L01).
EWF-X is an expirimental format intended for testing purposes to enhance the EWF format.
.Nm libewf
allows you to read and write media data in the EWF format.
.Pp
.Ar source
is the source or device file to acquire data from.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d Ar digest_type
calculate additional digest (hash) types besides md5, options: sha1
.It Fl h
shows this help
.It Fl l Ar filename
logs the digest (hash) to the filename
.It Fl q
quiet shows no status information
.It Fl s
swap byte pairs of the media data (from AB to BA)
(use this for big to little endian conversion and vice versa)
.It Fl v
verbose output to stderr
.It Fl V
print version
.El
.Pp
.Nm ewfacquire
will read from a file or device until it encounters a read error.
On read error it will retry the amount of retries specified.
If
.Nm ewfacquire
still is unable to read and, if specified, it will zero (wipe) the the remainder of the amount of sectors specified as error granularity.
If
.Nm ewfacquire
should mimic EnCase it will wipe all of sectors specified as error granularity.
.Pp
Empty block compression detects blocks of sectors with entirely the same byte data and compresses them using the default compression level.
.Pp
The encase6 and linen6 format allow for segment files greater than 2 GiB (2147483648 bytes).
